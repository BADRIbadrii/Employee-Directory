## 💭 Reflection

### Challenges Faced
- Matching exact spacing/margins/colors from UI screenshot using vanilla CSS
- Implementing client-side pagination and maintaining state (page, filters, etc.)
- Ensuring clean modular code with no backend interaction

### Improvements with More Time
- Implement Edit functionality
- Add sidebar filtering for Department and Role (like shown in your design)
- Improve UI/UX with animations and transitions
